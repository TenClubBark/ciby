I had a music teacher I used to visit once a week and he was
also a songwriter so I brought this to him and he was like... uh...
who is your target audience for this???

I sorta explained that I was thinking of that Police song "Every breath
you take" and how it was creepy and thought it would be funny to do something
similar, but he had a fair point.  Anyway...

[Older sketches... part 2]

I know I just met you but you seem like a fabulous guy
You smile when you talk and there's a complicated look in your eye
Yeah there is

I bet your life is great
I imagine you've got everything that I could ever dream about

Can I be you?
Can I look out through your eyes?
Can I be you?
I'd much rather be you than me

The building that you work in's so impressive
It's a place of glass
Tried to get inside it but security's a pain in the ass
Yeah it is
